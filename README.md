<h1>Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>👋 Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Ray. After many years in the business world, I'm diving back into coding after having programmed in Pascal, Lisp, machine language and assembly language as an undergrad at UC Berkeley.</li>
<li>🌱 I'm especially interested in learning and understanding the technologies that will be critical to products and solutions of the future. Currently, I am learning python with a focus on machine learning, deep learning and web deployment.</li>
<li>👀 I believe technology can and should be a force for good and I am super interested in applying transformative technologies to business, environmental and societal challenges.</li>
<li>💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine and deep learning projects where I can serve as a bridge between code and real world problems.</li>
<li>📫 You can reach me at <a href = "mailto: iray.min@gmail.com">iray.min@gmail.com</a>. Feel free to check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ray-min/">LinkedIn</a> profile.</li>
