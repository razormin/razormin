<h1>Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>👋 Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Ray and this is my space to learn about Git. So far, I've primariy used it as a repository for some of my Python coding, machine learning, deep learning, and web deployment exercises. But I'm also using it to follow repositories that I find interesting.</li>
<li>I started my programming journey with BASIC and then learned Pascal, Lisp, machine language and assembly language as an undergrad at UC Berkeley (I know, it dates me).</li>
<li>🌱 I'm especially interested in learning and understanding the technologies such as AI and cloud computing that will have tremendous impact on many industries and society.</li>
<li>💞️ I’m open to collaborating on projects where I can serve as a bridge between code and real world problems.</li>
<li>📫 You can reach me at <a href = "mailto: iray.min@gmail.com">iray.min@gmail.com</a>. Feel free to check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ray-min/">LinkedIn</a> profile.</li>
